CiteMe App Code

CiteMe is an application that allows the user to create and save citations and bibliographies. The user has an option of the type 
(book, journal, webpage, newspaper, or magazine) and which style (MLA, APA, Chicago) they would like to use. 
The application has a form that populates with all of the required information allowing the user to easily fill in what they need. You click the citeMe button at the bottom of the page and it generates the correct format for your citation.

There is a user registration and log-in component.

To launch the application: https://citeme.herokuapp.com/

We used NodeExpress to implement our code, and the repository is orginazed as NodeExpress built it.  

The user can also use a chrome extension for quick citations, and copy & paste them directly into their paper.

Chrome extension installation instructions:
First you must download the /ext directory from the repo. Now, open the chrome web browser. Type chrome://extenstions into the address bar. In the upper right hand corner, click "Developer mode". Then, in the upper left hand corner click "Load unpacked". Navigate to the /ext directory, and click open. The extension should now be installed. 
      Once you download the extension, you can update fields on the webpage by highlighting the text you want, like the author, and left click to navigate down to the citeMe extension. Select which field you wish to update, and that will update the form.
