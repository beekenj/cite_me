CiteMe App Code

CiteMe is an application that allows the user to create and save citations and bibliographies. The user has an option of the type 
(book, journal, webpage, newspaper, or magazine) and which style (MLA, APA, Chicago) they would like to use. 
The application has a form that populates with all of the required information allowing the user to easily fill in what they need.
It is then saved to their local page so they can use it as a reference at a later date.

There is a user registration and log-in component.

To launch the application: https://citeme.herokuapp.com/

The user can also use a chrome extension for quick citations, and copy & paste them directly into their paper.

Chrome extension installation instructions:
First you must download the /ext directory from the repo. Now, open the chrome web browser. Type chrome://extenstions into the address bar. In the upper right hand corner, click "Developer mode". Then, in the upper left hand corner click "Load unpacked". Navigate to the /ext directory, and click open. The extension should now be installed.
